# 3.1 Common Anti-Patterns

Common Anti (Bad) Patterns are as follows. And below is a debug list to catch them

## 3.1.1 Vague goals ("make it better") instead of testable criteria [A8]

❌ **Bad**:
```plain text
Summarize this report.
```

✅ **Fixed: Add rubric and eval set (testable criteria)**:
```plain text
Summarize this report for executives.
Output: 5 bullets, ≤12 words each, no acronyms unexplained.
Measure success: 90% of eval set meets length/style constraints.
```

## 3.1.2 Mixing instructions/examples/context in one blob; no delimiters/structure [A2][O1]

❌ **Bad**:
```plain text
Classify these tickets into bug/feature/question.
Ticket: Login not working. Ticket: Add dark mode.
Example: Bug = crash on save. Output JSON.
```

✅ **Fix: XML/sections + format template (structured sections with XML tags)**:
```plain text
<instructions>
- Classify as bug, feature, or question.
- Output JSON {id, label}.
</instructions>

<examples>
Input: "Crash when saving" → {"id":"ex1","label":"bug"}
</examples>

<input>
Ticket: Login not working.
Ticket: Add dark mode.
</input>
```

## 3.1.3 Overloading single‑turn prompts for complex tasks [A6][O2]

❌ **Bad**:
```plain text
Read this 30-page report and produce: a summary, a risk register, and an action plan.
```

✅ **Fix: Chain into steps and/or agentic flow with stop conditions**:
```plain text
Step 1: Summarize the 30-page report (≤200 words).
Step 2: Extract risks from the summary, format as {risk, owner, deadline}.
Step 3: Draft a 5-item action plan based on risks.
```

## 3.1.4 Asking for perfect structure but not showing an example [G1]

❌ **Bad**:
```plain text
Output structured JSON with key insights.
```

✅ **Fix: Provide few‑shot with consistent formatting for clarity**:
```plain text
Extract insights from text and return JSON.

Example:
Input: "Login fails after 3 attempts"
Output: {"issue":"login retry bug","category":"bug","severity":"high"}
Now do the same for:
"Need multi-language support"
```

## 3.1.5 No guardrails (model free to hallucinate or over-answer) [A10][A11][G2]

❌ **Bad**:
```plain text
Answer any user question.
```

✅ **Fix: Add refusal policy, source constraints, JSON mode/schemas, safety settings etc**:
```plain text
Use only the provided documents below to answer.
If insufficient info, respond: "I don't know."

Forbidden: fabricating citations, answering outside docs.
