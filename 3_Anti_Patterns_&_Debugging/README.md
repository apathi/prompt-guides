## Key Principle

The best way to improve prompts is to recognize and fix common mistakes:
- Vague goals instead of testable criteria
- Mixed instructions without structure
- Overloading single-turn prompts
- Missing examples for complex formats
- No guardrails or safety measures

Each anti-pattern includes both the **bad** example and the **fixed** version showing proper implementation.
