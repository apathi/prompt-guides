# 3.2 Debug Checklist

```plain text
1) Does prompt state goal, audience, format, and constraints up front?
2) Are context and examples clearly delimited (e.g., XML tags)?
3) Is there a schema/template + one worked example?
4) For complex tasks: split into plan → act → verify (multi-turn if needed).
5) Are tool rules, stop conditions, and safety constraints explicit?
6) Is there an eval suite to measure changes between versions?
7) Does the prompt specify a stop condition and tool budget?
8) Are acceptance criteria stated up front and verified at the end?
