# The Ultimate Prompting Guide : (Anthropic x OpenAI x Google) - Official Best Practices

_Last update : Sept 15, 2025_

A comprehensive, side‑by‑side synthesis of official prompting guidance from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini. Each section blends shared best practices and highlights where guidance differs. All Inline references to official sources use tags like [A1], [O1], [G1] and are expanded at the end.

## **Why This Guide Exists**

Prompt engineering is everywhere, but clear, actionable *comparisons* across providers are rare. Most guides are either model-specific, overly abstract, or filled with internet noise.

So I went to the source.

> This guide is the result of a detailed synthesis of official best-practices documentation from:
> 
- OpenAI ([GPT-4 & GPT-5 Prompting Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering))
- Anthropic ([Claude Prompt Engineering Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview))
- Gemini ([Prompting Strategies Guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies))

I parsed, compared, and distilled their strategies — so you don’t have to.

## **⚠️ What This Guide Isn’t**

To be clear: **this isn’t a general-purpose “how to prompt” guide**, nor does it cover prompt *engineering techniques*, *context window management*, *embedding strategies*, or *multi-agent architectures*.

> Those are important — and I’ll cover them in a different post — but this guide is focused solely on **refining prompts for effective single-turn or few-turn usage**
> 

Think of this as your go-to **tactical prompt design reference**.

## **🧩 What’s Inside**

You’ll find:

- **Side-by-side breakdowns** of prompting advice from the big 3 - OpenAI , Anthropic, Google Gemini
- **Illustrated patterns** including XML-tagged prompts, tool preambles, structured output formats
- **A “CAPSTONE” advanced example** that implements *all* best practices in one real-world use case
- **Model-specific differences**: like how Anthropic leans into tool use via XML schemas, how OpenAI uses reasoning_effort, and how Gemini focuses on safety + formatting
- **Prompt Optimizing Tools**: Guide to each provider's official prompt refining & evaluating tools. You can optimize your prompts w/ — playgrounds, workbenches, and parameter controls that let you quickly test and improve prompts before deployment

Each tip is backed by citations like [A1] (Anthropic), [O2] (OpenAI), [G1] (Gemini) — and the full guide includes these references inline and in context. Full List of references listed seperately.

## **🏗️ Why Comparative Prompting Matters**

When switching between providers (e.g., using Claude for safety + long-context tasks, GPT-5 for structured reasoning, Gemini for summaries with formatting), prompt techniques don’t always transfer 1:1.

This guide is built to:

- **Reduce trial and error** when switching models
- **Align with native features and quirks** of each API
- **Speed up effective adoption** of multi-provider workflows

## **💡 Sample Insight**

For example:

> “Tool Preambles”
> 

> Anthropic, by contrast, uses tool_use blocks that require explicit schema definitions for function inputs and outputs.
> 

> Gemini leans on few-shot examples to enforce safe, consistent behavior.
> 

The difference?

🧠 OpenAI assumes the model plans.

🧰 Anthropic wants you to architect a tool loop.

📐 Gemini pushes for formatting consistency and safety.

## **🔬 Who This Is For**

This guide is ideal for:

- **Prompt engineers** tuning LLM-based agents and tools
- **Developers** building with multi-model stacks (e.g. OpenAI + Claude fallback)
- **Product managers** wanting to better communicate prompting strategies with their teams
- **AI-curious folks** who want to understand prompt design at a systems level

### **🔑 Best Practices Illustrated**
- **System prompt** (persistent role & rules): fixes persona, tone, refusal policy.
- **Tool preamble** (OpenAI-style): plan → act → narrate → stop; ensures transparent agent behavior.
- **Safety budget**: explicit limits on tool calls, unsafe inputs, and refusal triggers.
- **Instructions first, reminders last**: bookended constraints to survive long-context drift.
- **XML segmentation**: \<instructions\>, \<examples\>, \<context\>, \<format\> ensure clarity.
- **Few-shot example**: short, consistent, schema-aligned illustration.
- **Schema + format template**: guarantees structured output that downstream apps can parse.
- **Guardrails**: "don't invent KPIs," "safe refusal," JSON-only output.
- **Long-context strategy**: summary cap, repetition of key rules at end.
- **Self-containment**: evaluation criteria embedded (≤120 words, ≤2 tool calls, JSON-safe).
