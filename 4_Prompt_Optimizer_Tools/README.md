# 4. Prompt Optimizer Tools Guide

## What Are Prompt Optimizer Tools?
Prompt Optimizer tools help you **refine, test, and evaluate** your initial rough prompts to improve the quality, reliability, and performance of outputs from large language models (LLMs). These tools are provided by model vendors like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google themselves to support developers and researchers in designing prompts that are:
- More accurate and goal-aligned
- Safer and more compliant with model behavior rules
- Easier to maintain and iterate across projects
- Compatible with structured output formats or agent workflows

They often include side-by-side comparisons, automated suggestions, and evaluation harnesses to streamline prompt development.
