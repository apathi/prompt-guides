# 1.11 Safety & Guardrails

- Use safety prompts and platform safety settings; throttle unsafe categories when needed; design refusals and "ask‑before‑acting" rules. [A10][A13][G2]

```plain text
If request is outside policy or sources are insufficient:
- Brief refusal + safe alternative.
- Never fabricate citations.
