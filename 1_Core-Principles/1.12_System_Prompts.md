# 1.12 System Prompts (Persistent Role & Guardrails)

- Use **system prompts** to set durable role, tone, citation rules, refusal policy, and tool usage defaults; keep user prompts task-specific. Reinforce key rules at the end ("bookend" pattern). [A7][A3]

```plain text
<SystemPrompt>
Role: Senior policy analyst; tone: neutral.
Rules: Cite sources; never fabricate citations; prefer "I don't know" over guessing.
Safety: Refuse disallowed requests with brief alternative.
</SystemPrompt>
