# 1.9 Use Tools & Retrieval Thoughtfully

- Prefer native **tool/function calling** over parsing. Define tool names, params, and guardrails; be explicit when to use which tool. [A12]

```plain text
# Tools available
- search(q): web snippets (use for fresh facts)
- calc(expr): numeric evaluation (never mental math)

Rule: If any number needed → use calc. For facts after 2023 → use search.
```

- For agentic flows, use Responses API to persist state across tool calls; this improves instruction adherence and reduces drift in multi-step tasks.[[1]](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)[[2]](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide)
- Pair each tool rule with a stop condition and success signal to prevent runaway loops.
