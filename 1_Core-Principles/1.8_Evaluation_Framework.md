# 1.8 Lightweight Evaluation Framework (Scoring)

- Build a tiny, repeatable eval harness (20–50 cases) with **scoring rubrics** (e.g., format=1, factuality=2, style=1). Track deltas per prompt version. [A8][O1]

```plain text
Eval set: 40 items (10/class).

Rubric (0–1 unless noted):
- Format (0/1) – matches schema exactly
- Factuality (0–2) – correct facts with sources
- Style (0/1) – tone, length bounds
- Safety (0/1) – refuses when required

Pass criteria: ≥ 85% total; no class < 70%.
